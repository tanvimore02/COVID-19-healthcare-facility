The project will help India prevent, detect, respond and prepare for the Covid-19 pandemic and strengthen its public health awareness.

The Python program firsts takes all the details of the arrived passenger. It then asks which country the passenger has visited recently. According to the country visited, the program prompts whether or not the passenger has travel history from any Covid-19 affected region.
If the person has no travel history from Covid-19 affected area, he/she is asked to self-quarantine else, he/she is taken to the nearest hospital for further check-ups and tests in the city they have landed.
The program gives ample options to the passenger to choose the hospital of their choice and keeps a count of patients in every hospital.
In the end, once all the data has been recorded, the program creates an excel file of the data of that day.

Reminder: Make an empty excel spreadsheet before recording the data and close the while recording the data.
